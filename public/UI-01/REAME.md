[tweetping](http://tweetping.net/) is awesome! and [raphael](http://raphaeljs.com/) is awesome, too! Thanks for letting me konw thease two awesome stuffs.

I used [raphael worldmap](http://raphaeljs.com/world/) to render world map, and [raphael icons](http://raphaeljs.com/icons/) to display different shapes depending on the activity types.

see [demo](http://cs.aproxacs.me/corona) first.

## flows
When an activity is added, it adds a marker to the map as well as the message box. And the stat count is updated. 
There is time range slider, under the world map. If you change the range of time, only activities between the time range are shown. At this moment, older activities(closer to the start of time range) has lower opacities.
